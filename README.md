- What about  considering a function that every one second do reduction and replace the string?!!!
And we need to clear set timeout for pause or cancel. 
We might need things like<br>
`Let count=25;`
`Count--`
`document.querySelector().innerHTML`

- Actually if we are going to have settimeout so which function should put for callback.


- After I have writen basic html and css I have noticed that "oh" we have **minutes** and **seconds** means after 60 seconds should change minues ?!!!!!!!!

- Can I make a reaping function for seconds? like every 59 seconds comes back to start and for minutes every 60000 reduce 1 !!!!???????? :clock12:
- Do I need to use `setTimeut` or `seInterval` ?
