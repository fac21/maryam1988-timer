What about  considering a function that every one second do reduction and replace the string?!!!  And we need to clear set timeout for pause or cancel. 
We might need things like
`Let count=25;`
`Count--`
`document.querySelector().innerHTML`
Actually if we are going to have settimeout so which function should put for callback.
