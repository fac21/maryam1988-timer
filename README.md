What about  considering a function that every one second do reduction and replace the string?!!!
And we need to clear set timeout for pause or cancel. 
We might need things like<br>
`Let count=25;` <br>
`Count--`<br>
`document.querySelector().innerHTML`<br>

Actually if we are going to have settimeout so which function should put for callback.


- After I have writen basic html and css I have noticed that "oh" we have **minutes** and **seconds** means after 60 seconds should change minues ?!!!!!!!!
